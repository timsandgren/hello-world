# hello-world
This is where mwe will ponder the next generation of software for automated small business administration.
I want to find or found a team that work transdisciplinarily.
The first change of the hello world program was made to initiate a most general line of inquiry. We go from the more general to the more specific in this project; as we want to generate a theory for (and a practice of) scientific cooperation.
